This document describes the design of the
[x](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk/pkg/x)
package collection, which contains experimental packages.
Historically, `x` was an independent repository, but we
merged it into the main RBMK repository on 2025-07-03.

The [x](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk/pkg/x)
collection does not need to contain stable packages and its packages
may not have 100% of code coverage. It is a place for
experimentation, and may contained unstable,
untested, obsolete, or broken code.

When a package added to
[x](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk/pkg/x)
matures, we will ensure it has full test coverage and
then move it to another package category, such as `./pkg/dns`.
