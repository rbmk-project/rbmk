This document describes the design of the [rbmk-project.github.io](
https://github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk-project.github.io) repository, which
contains the public website for the [rbmk project](https://github.com/rbmk-project),
specifications, design documents, and other documentation.

The [rbmk-project.github.io](https://github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk-project.github.io)
publishes content at https://rbmk-project.github.io/.

We also let GitHub Pages automatically render  specific documentation from
the `./docs` directory of the [rbmk](https://github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk) repository.
This ensures there is less churn when making changes to the code and the docs.

Such docs are mounted at https://rbmk-project.github.io/rbmk/.

We'll take advantage of GitHub pages automatic rendering of markdown files to
avoid having to maintain two separate repositories for the website and
the technical documentation, with potential for inconsistencies.
